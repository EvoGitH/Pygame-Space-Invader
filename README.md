# Pygame-Space-Invader
I'm just creating a repository of learning how to use Pygame, by creating the Space Invader game, 
using some assets I personally made, ~~or just downloaded off the internet.~~
Feel free to look through my spaghetti code and see if any of it helps you, 

I somewhat doubt my novice butt could help anyone, but hey maybe the simplest things are what you need.
I'm using GitHub to track my progress, how far I can get into this, and how much I failed.

If you guys got comments about my ~~spag~~ code, feel free, not like I can stop you anyways.

I've gotten a lot better since my first time uploading to this site, learned what classes are, how to define a function, OOP structure even.
thanks Ryan :D
